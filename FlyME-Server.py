Development Logs:
    - Server waiting for client to connect
    - Data format from client (32-byte-string):  mode,height,roll,pitch,yaw,angle,cheksum,...
                                                 Mode:             1 byte
                                                 Height:           5 bytes in unit of millimeter
                                                 Roll, Pitch, Yaw: Each has 3 bytes number from 0-200
                                                 Angle:            3 bytes indicate angle if smarphone (front) with respect to north pole
                                                 Checksum:
                                                 
    - Mode byte meaning
      Bit 0 = Arm/Disarm
      Bit 1 = Takeoff/Landing
      Bit 2,3 ==> 00=Hoover, 01=Self frame, 10=Earth fame, 11=Smartphone frame
